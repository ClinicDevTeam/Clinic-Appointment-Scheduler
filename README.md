## Introduction
The **Clinic Appointment Scheduler** is a web application designed to simplify the process of booking, managing, and canceling medical appointments at walk-in clinics. Built using C# and .NET in Visual Studio 2022, the app aims to reduce wait times and eliminate the inefficiencies of manual booking systems for both patients and clinic staff.

## Problem
Visiting walk-in clinics and booking medical appointments in Canada can often be time-consuming, inefficient, and frustrating for both patients and healthcare providers. Many clinics still rely on manual and in-person systems which lead to long wait times and poor coordination. Patients often spend hours waiting for medical services that only take minutes to deliver, creating unnecessary strain on both sides.

## Project Idea/ Solution
The Clinical Appointment Scheduler is a user-friendly web application to reduce clinic congestion and improve patient access.  Patients can easily:  
‚Ä¢	Book Appointment  
‚Ä¢	View Appointments  
‚Ä¢	Update Appointment  
‚Ä¢	Cancel Appointment  
Clinics can manage daily schedules and improve staff planning with real-time updates.

Excluded in this version are:  
‚Ä¢	User accounts/logins  
‚Ä¢	Notifications (email/SMS)  
‚Ä¢	Patient registration  
‚Ä¢	Mobile responsiveness
